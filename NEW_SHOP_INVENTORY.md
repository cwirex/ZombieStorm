### **A Comprehensive Guide to the 10-Level Weapon Upgrade System**

#### **1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines a complete redesign of the weapon upgrade system, built around a 10-level progression path for each weapon. The core philosophy is to provide a clear and satisfying sense of growth while maintaining a balanced game economy.

- **Structured Progression:** The 10 levels are structured in three phases:
  1.  **Levels 2-4: Foundational Boosts.** Cheap, single-stat upgrades to make a new weapon viable.
  2.  **Level 5: The Power Spike.** A significant, more expensive upgrade that enhances the weapon's core function.
  3.  **Levels 6-10: Specialization.** Very expensive, multi-stat upgrades that culminate in a unique, gameplay-altering **Level 10 "Ultimate" ability**.
- **Balanced Economy:** The upgrade costs are a direct percentage of the weapon's base price. This ensures that fully upgrading a weapon costs **300%** of its initial purchase price, making it a major investment.
- **Strategic Choice:** The system is balanced so that buying a higher-tier weapon is often more cost-effective than fully maxing out a lower-tier one. This encourages players to progress through the arsenal, saving the "max-out" strategy for their favorite endgame weapons.

#### **2. The Universal Upgrade & Cost Formula**

Every weapon in the game follows this precise cost structure. This creates predictability and allows players to plan their spending.

| Level                  | Cost (% of Base Price) | Upgrade Type         |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- |
| **1**                  | 100% (Weapon Purchase) | Unlocks Weapon       |
| **2**                  | 5%                     | Minor Stat Boost     |
| **3**                  | 8%                     | Minor Stat Boost     |
| **4**                  | 12%                    | Minor Stat Boost     |
| **5**                  | **30%**                | **Major Stat Spike** |
| **6**                  | 35%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **7**                  | 40%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **8**                  | 45%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **9**                  | 50%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **10 (MAX)**           | **75%**                | **Ultimate Ability** |
| **Total Upgrade Cost** | **300%**               |                      |
| **Total Investment**   | **400%**               |                      |

#### **3. Weapon Roster & New Pricing Strategy**

#### **5. Rationale & Design Notes**

- **Balanced DPS Progression:** All weapons now follow the 100-150% DPS increase target:
  - **Pistol:** 60 â†’ 147 DPS (145% increase) with 40% double-shot chance
  - **SMG:** 242 â†’ 624 DPS (158% increase) with 25% critical hit chance  
  - **M4:** 385 â†’ 696+ DPS (181% increase) with % health damage vs strong enemies
  - **LMG:** 480 â†’ 761 DPS (159% increase) with ammo regeneration utility
  - **Flamethrower:** 400 â†’ 1138 DPS (185% increase) with sustained fire bonus
- **Ultimate Ability Design:** Each Level 10 ability enhances the weapon's identity:
  - **Pistol:** Reliable with chance-based double shots
  - **SMG:** High-volume fire with critical hit potential
  - **M4:** Anti-armor specialist effective vs tough enemies
  - **LMG:** Sustained fire expert with ammo sustainability
  - **Flamethrower:** Area denial with ramping damage
- **Removed Mechanics:** AWP no longer requires scoping for streamlined 2D gameplay

This comprehensive system provides a robust framework for long-term player engagement, ensuring that the journey from a base-level UZI to a fully-mastered, ultimate-unlocked AWP is a long and satisfying one.

### **Consumables with a New Philosophy**

The goal with consumables is to make them a strategic choice, not a resource to be hoarded. By implementing a dynamic pricing system, we encourage players to think carefully about when to heal or when to use a tactical item.

#### **Medkits: Dynamic Pricing**

The price of a Medkit now increases dramatically based on how many you already own. This prevents players from easily stockpiling them and makes buying one a significant strategic choice.

$$\text{Medkit Cost} = \$200 \times (1.7)^{\text{Number of Medkits Owned}}$$

This new formula, with a higher base cost and a steeper multiplier, means buying even a second Medkit is a serious investment. This will make players rely more on tactical positioning and avoiding damage rather than simply healing through it.

- Cost to buy your 1st Medkit: $200
- Cost to buy your 2nd Medkit: $340
- Cost to buy your 3rd Medkit: $578
- Cost to buy your 4th Medkit: $983

#### **TNTs: A Tactical Investment**

Increasing the price of TNT makes it a more tactical tool rather than something to be spammed carelessly.

- Single TNT: $50
- TNT Pack (10x): $480 (a small discount for buying in bulk)

### **Ammunition: No More Micromanagement**

To streamline the gameplay and keep the focus on permanent upgrades, we've completely removed ammo purchases from the shop.

- **Automatic Refills:** Players now start every wave with a full stock of ammunition for all owned weapons.
- **Focus on Upgrades:** This change focuses 100% of the player's spending on permanent, exciting upgrades for their weapons. The only resource to manage during a wave is the ammo in your current magazine, which makes the **Magazine Capacity** stat a much more valuable and noticeable upgrade.

This revised system is simpler for the player, promotes more aggressive and fun build strategies, and perfectly aligns with our vision for a wild and rewarding gameplay experience.
