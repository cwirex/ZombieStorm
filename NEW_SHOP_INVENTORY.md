### **A Comprehensive Guide to the 10-Level Weapon Upgrade System**

#### **1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines a complete redesign of the weapon upgrade system, built around a 10-level progression path for each weapon. The core philosophy is to provide a clear and satisfying sense of growth while maintaining a balanced game economy.

- **Structured Progression:** The 10 levels are structured in three phases:
  1.  **Levels 2-4: Foundational Boosts.** Cheap, single-stat upgrades to make a new weapon viable.
  2.  **Level 5: The Power Spike.** A significant, more expensive upgrade that enhances the weapon's core function.
  3.  **Levels 6-10: Specialization.** Very expensive, multi-stat upgrades that culminate in a unique, gameplay-altering **Level 10 "Ultimate" ability**.
- **Balanced Economy:** The upgrade costs are a direct percentage of the weapon's base price. This ensures that fully upgrading a weapon costs **300%** of its initial purchase price, making it a major investment.
- **Strategic Choice:** The system is balanced so that buying a higher-tier weapon is often more cost-effective than fully maxing out a lower-tier one. This encourages players to progress through the arsenal, saving the "max-out" strategy for their favorite endgame weapons.

#### **2. The Universal Upgrade & Cost Formula**

Every weapon in the game follows this precise cost structure. This creates predictability and allows players to plan their spending.

| Level                  | Cost (% of Base Price) | Upgrade Type         |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------- |
| **1**                  | 100% (Weapon Purchase) | Unlocks Weapon       |
| **2**                  | 5%                     | Minor Stat Boost     |
| **3**                  | 8%                     | Minor Stat Boost     |
| **4**                  | 12%                    | Minor Stat Boost     |
| **5**                  | **30%**                | **Major Stat Spike** |
| **6**                  | 35%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **7**                  | 40%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **8**                  | 45%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **9**                  | 50%                    | Combined Stat Boost  |
| **10 (MAX)**           | **75%**                | **Ultimate Ability** |
| **Total Upgrade Cost** | **300%**               |                      |
| **Total Investment**   | **400%**               |                      |

#### **3. Weapon Roster & New Pricing Strategy**

#### **5. Rationale & Design Notes**

- **Ultimate Ability Design:** Each Level 10 ability is designed to be a powerful capstone that fundamentally enhances the weapon's core identity rather than just adding more damage. The M249 rewards sustained fire, the AWP rewards targeting wounded elites, and the Shotgun becomes the undisputed king of point-blank range.
- **Why No Lifesteal (Vampire Effect)?** While a "vampire" effect is a cool idea, it can be extremely difficult to balance. If it's too strong, it can negate the game's difficulty and remove the need for medkits or skillful dodging. If it's too weak, it feels unrewarding for a final upgrade. It's best kept for special events, temporary power-ups, or a potential "mutator" game mode.
- **Alternative Ideas:**
  - **UZI Lvl 10:** Could have a "Vampire" effect instead of a slow, e.g., "Heal for 1% of damage dealt." This would be high-risk/high-reward, forcing you to get close to heal.
  - **M4 Lvl 10:** Could have "Ricochet Rounds," allowing bullets to bounce to one nearby enemy, enhancing its crowd-control capabilities.

This comprehensive system provides a robust framework for long-term player engagement, ensuring that the journey from a base-level UZI to a fully-mastered, ultimate-unlocked AWP is a long and satisfying one.

### **Consumables with a New Philosophy**

The goal with consumables is to make them a strategic choice, not a resource to be hoarded. By implementing a dynamic pricing system, we encourage players to think carefully about when to heal or when to use a tactical item.

#### **Medkits: Dynamic Pricing**

The price of a Medkit now increases dramatically based on how many you already own. This prevents players from easily stockpiling them and makes buying one a significant strategic choice.

$$\text{Medkit Cost} = \$200 \times (1.7)^{\text{Number of Medkits Owned}}$$

This new formula, with a higher base cost and a steeper multiplier, means buying even a second Medkit is a serious investment. This will make players rely more on tactical positioning and avoiding damage rather than simply healing through it.

- Cost to buy your 1st Medkit: $200
- Cost to buy your 2nd Medkit: $340
- Cost to buy your 3rd Medkit: $578
- Cost to buy your 4th Medkit: $983

#### **TNTs: A Tactical Investment**

Increasing the price of TNT makes it a more tactical tool rather than something to be spammed carelessly.

- Single TNT: $50
- TNT Pack (10x): $480 (a small discount for buying in bulk)

### **Ammunition: No More Micromanagement**

To streamline the gameplay and keep the focus on permanent upgrades, we've completely removed ammo purchases from the shop.

- **Automatic Refills:** Players now start every wave with a full stock of ammunition for all owned weapons.
- **Focus on Upgrades:** This change focuses 100% of the player's spending on permanent, exciting upgrades for their weapons. The only resource to manage during a wave is the ammo in your current magazine, which makes the **Magazine Capacity** stat a much more valuable and noticeable upgrade.

This revised system is simpler for the player, promotes more aggressive and fun build strategies, and perfectly aligns with our vision for a wild and rewarding gameplay experience.
